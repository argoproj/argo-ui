## Local Development

To test your changes locally against Argo CD or another Argo project, we recommend using [yalc](https://github.com/wclr/yalc).

First, install `yalc`:

```
npm i -g yalc
```

Next, in your local `argo-ui` directory, run

```
yalc publish
```

Finally, in your local `argo-cd/ui` directory, run

```
yalc add argo-ui
```

Your local changes to the `argo-ui` package will now be seen by your local `argo-cd`.
